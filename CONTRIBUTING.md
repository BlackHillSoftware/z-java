# How to Contribute

Thanks for contributing!

This project is in its early stages so we haven't developed strict contribution guidelines.

The objective of the project is to promote the use of Java on z/OS by providing samples and useful Java programs for z/OS programmers and systems programmers. We welcome contributions from the community. 

As a general rule, please try to ensure contributions:
- have enough explanatory documentation and/or comments that others who are not so familiar with Java on z/OS can understand what they do and how they do it
- where-ever practical, maintain backwards compatibility when changing an existing sample

These guidelines will no doubt evolve over time.
